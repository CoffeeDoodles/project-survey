# Survey: All About Jane (Austen)

## Goal: 
  * Using React to build a survey form for the first time. 
  * Understanding States in React and controlling forms through questions the user must answer.
  * Saving that information and displaying it at the end of the survey. 
  * There is no backend set up for this project... yet. ;)

## Tools:
  * JavaScript
  * React
  * styled-components
  * material-ui
